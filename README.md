## 🔮 Future Features & Recommendations

This project is continuously evolving. Here is the roadmap for upcoming features and architectural improvements:

* **Global Social Feed:** Expand the app from a personal utility to a community platform. Implement a public feed where users can publish their journal entries, share what they are currently watching.

* **SEO & Deep Linking (Expo Router):** Migrate from the current state-based Single Page App (SPA) routing to Expo Router. This will introduce file-based routing, enabling shareable URLs for specific movies (e.g., `.../movie/123`), dynamic metadata, and vastly improved SEO for the web deployment.

* **Evolved Design System:** Abstract the current Tailwind/NativeWind utility classes into a strict, reusable design system component library.

* **Performance & Asset Optimization:** Continue optimizing the web build.

* **Advanced Journaling:** Add rich text formatting to the journal composer, allowing users to tag specific actors, rate movies on a granular scale, and export their reviews.
